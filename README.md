# rs-stellar-strkey

Library and CLI containing types and functionality for working with Stellar
Strkeys.

**This repository contains code that is in early development, incomplete,
not tested, and not recommended for use. The API is unstable, experimental,
and is receiving breaking changes frequently.**

### Usage

#### Library
To use the library, include in your toml:

```toml
stellar-strkey = "..."
```

This crate does not depend on the `std` crate and can be used in `no_std` environments.
However, please note that it relies on the [`alloc`](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/collections/#using-alloc) crate for certain types such as `Vec`.

#### CLI

To use the CLI:

```console
cargo install --locked stellar-strkey --version ... --features cli
```

##### Examples

Decode a `G` account/public-key strkey:
```console
$ stellar-strkey decode GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWHF
PublicKeyEd25519(PublicKey(0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000))
```

Decode a `C` contract strkey:
```console
$ stellar-strkey decode CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABSC4
Contract(Contract(0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000))
```
